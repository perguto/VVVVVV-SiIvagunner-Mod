# VVVVVV SiIvagunner Mod

This mod adds all the SiIvagunner and Timmy Turner's Grand Dad Song Parodies to VVVVVV.

## How to Install

1. Open your VVVVVV game folder and unzip `data.zip` into a new folder.
2. (Make sure you have activated `Show filename extensions` in Windows Explorer.) Rename `data.zip` (e. g. to `data_original.zip`) and name the folder you have unzipped in step 1 `data.zip` (the game will only be able to find the assets if the folder has this exact name.)
3. Open this new `data.zip` folder and rename the file `vvvvvvmusic.vvv` (e. g. to `vvvvvvmusic_original.vvv`) as well as the file `souleyeminijingle.wav` in the `sounds` folder and `sprites.png` in the `graphics` folder.
4. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/perguto/VVVVVV-SiIvagunner-Mod/releases/download/v1/vvvvvv_siivagunner_mod_v1.zip), unzip it and drag `data.zip` folder of the mod into your VVVVV folder so that it gets merged with the `data.zip` folder of the game. If you did everything right, your folder should look like this:

5. Put the file

Enjoy! You should hear the high-quality music right on the title menu. 

If the File extensions don't show up, you have to set this checkmark in Windows Explorer:
